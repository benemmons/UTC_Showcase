        Hi, I'm Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a year 10 student at UTC Reading who's currently studying computer science. I always find myself lacking an elegant solution
        to spread the word about the projects I have made to other people, usually having to resort to word-of-mouth or annoying
        emails. I also find that, when describing these projects, a lot of detail is lost as it's a bit long for just a quick
        email.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where the blog comes in, having a centralised website for people to post their projects in as much detail as they
        want allows for other students to see their accomplishments and provide relevent (hopefully helpful!) feedback. It
        also allows for students to show employers or other interested people their project, without having to rewrite all
        of the information about it.
    </p>
    <p>I'm open for the blog to accomodate all sorts of content, from programming to music. To any students reading this, feel
        free to shoot me an email at
        <a href="mailto:benjamin.emmons@utcreading.org.uk">benjamin.emmons@utcreading.org.uk</a> and we can talk about getting a post set up.
    </p>
    <p>I hope you all enjoy the site.
    </p>
